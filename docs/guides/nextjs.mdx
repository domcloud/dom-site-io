[![](/assets/deploy.svg)](https://my.domcloud.co/start?from=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/domcloud/dom-templates/master/boot/nextjs.yml)

## Recipe Features Explained

Let's breakdown the recipe to deploy a new Next.js site.

<details>
<summary> See Full Deployment Script </summary>

```
source: clear
features:
- node lts
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: 'on'
    app_start_command: env PORT=$PORT yarn start
  locations:
    - match: /_next/static/
      alias: public_html/.next/static/
commands:
  - yes "" | yarn create next-app .
  - yarn build
```

</details>


```yaml
source: clear
features:
- node lts
commands:
  - yes "" | yarn create next-app .
```

This script clears `~/public_html` and installing the latest Node LTS version and creates a new blank nexjs project via `yarn create`.

When you upload an existing next.js project, the `yarn create` part is omitted.


```yaml
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: 'on'
    app_start_command: env PORT=$PORT yarn start
  locations:
    - match: /_next/static/
      alias: public_html/.next/static/
```

This script declare NGINX Configuration. It means two thing:

1. `root: public_html/public` means all static files are put to `public` folder. This is the recommended way to serve Nextjs for reverse proxy like NGINX.

1. `env PORT=$PORT yarn start` means run `yarn start` for all requests that doesn't found in `public_html/public`.

3. `alias: public_html/.next/static/` for `match: /_next/static/` means to speedup static files so they get proper cache and etag headers.

```yaml
commands:
  - yarn build
```

This script compiles the frontend required before serving with production settings.
