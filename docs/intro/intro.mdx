## Our Services

Please read our [Free Plan Guide](./free-plan.mdx) to know what limitations are in set for using our services freely. You also need [an invite code](./invitation-code.mdx) to enjoy our free plan.

We also have a page to compare [between our plans](./compare-plans.mdx) and [our servers](./compare-server.mdx). We also have an option for self-hosting if you wish to [have your own infra cloud](./self-hosting.mdx) hosted here.
