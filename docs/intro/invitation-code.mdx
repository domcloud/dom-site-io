# Invitation Code

This page is about why and how we ended up using Invitation Codes for enjoying DOM Cloud Free Features, and how can you help protecting us from bots and deliver best security to our overall service.

## Why Invitation Codes?

When you enjoy our services there might be a time that you want to recommend this service to your friend or collegues, and enjoy our free service. You can generate an invitation code for them so they can join in.

Historically, we don't have any concept of invitation codes until bots mocks up our server, creating a new fresh website every seconds. That's also means our NGINX servers reloads every seconds and it's not good. That's even after we put many IP-based limitations.

Invitation codes are the solution for those who wish doesn't want to spend a dime to our service. It acts like a powerful replacement for today-obsolete Captcha as only human can ask nicely for an invitation code on our community forum.

Invitation codes can be generated by existing customers who is actively subscribing, can be reused according to specific limit or be recreated without limit.

## Rewards

Anytime a new user registers with your invitation code, the total signups are incremented and you can see it in your dashboard.

When that user **upgrades**, you're rewarded with 1 credit  **once** per user. A credit is a virtual internet point that can be redeemed as a discount when renewing a plan that translates to:

| Plan | Full Price Monthly | Price per Credit | Total Credit Needed Monthly |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lite | $1.5 | $1.5 | 1 |
| Kit | $5 | $2.5 | 2 |
| Pro | $10 | $3.3 | 3 |
| Max | $20 | $4.0 | 5 |

This credit is not transferable, not refundable and can't be turned to real money.

## Sharing Invitation Code

This code is not a referral code, it's designed to keep us from bad actor.

Every code has a quota, the default is 20. This quota can be refreshed again at another 20. You can ask us to increase this quota for a special event or to be put to a private course.

With small quota, it's generally safe to put the code in public chat. However, be caution that when a bad actor get banned, the referred code will be instantly revoked. Repeated revocation will ban you from recreating another code. So, be caution when sharing it.
