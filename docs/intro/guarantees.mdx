We want everyone make use of our cloud platorm for a better experience with putting things online. Personally, the reason I (the founder) created this platform because I once struggled to find a web hosting service that's good enough for a university project.

Our mission is to democratize computing. What we mean by that is we want to make web deployment easy for everyone no matter their background, and as realistically done as possible using shared hosting design.

With that said, we have to be honest that we can't provide everything due to shared hosting nature.

## What we can't do

These are the things that we won't or can't do:

### Horizontal Scaling

We [can't scale horizontally](https://www.mongodb.com/basics/horizontal-vs-vertical-scaling#what-is-horizontal-scaling) because our servers is **monolithic** by design. Monolithic means only one machine located in one place for all services that your website needs.

Scaling horizontally means using some advanced techniques like load balancing, edge servers, edge functions, containerizations etc. We believe adding technical complexity will just make developers life harder. We want to keep things simple and easy to use. Read [the cloud exit by DHH](https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-big-cloud-exit-faq-20274010).

We still can scale vertically by our customer demands.

### No Failover

We given users a raw access (SSH) to the server, so they can do whatever they want with it. Practically, one can use our servers abusively, like training a machine learning model. That won't work. We have RAM and CPU limits in place to avoid accidentally freezing our whole server.

Still, things can go offline, for instance during bad root-level configuration by our admins. We strive to make our cloud platform recover from bad things autonomously. But, sometime have to "touch" our servers to keep everyone happy.

A bad actor can sneak up and wreak havoc despite many security protections in place. In that case they're violating [ToS](/service) like planting phising, DoS, spam, and other malicious activities to our servers. If someone legitimately needed a higher computing spec and it's not measurable by our limits (like storage and data cap) we will contact them.

Most of the time, downtime will not caused by us, could be your bad configuration. Or we do something that brokes your bad configuration. So expect some downtime here and there, but don't hesitate to contact us promptly if something is wrong!

## What we can do

Don't mind with all the drawbacks above? Great! Here are the things that we think you'll love:

### File Access

File access is often underrated in today's cloud computing world. The reason you wouldn't see people running PHP web-apps inside containers often is because this language is heavily depends with local file operations (e.g. for sessions and file uploads). 

Having file access is the simplest solution to cache and store data problem. If you're not choosing a monolithic service then you would have take alternative solutions like Redis or Memcached for cache and S3 storages for file uploads. Still, most people gave up using horizontally scalable system because it's either too complex or too costly to manage. 

Don't follow bad advices that told you need for maximum scalability without market or business validation. Unless you're scaling for international market or put people money or life behind your services, a single monolithic server will be enough for you.

Files in DOM Cloud can be accessed and edited using our Deployment System, Webmin, Filestash, SSH or VSCode Editor.

### Incremental Build

If your web app have a particularly large packages depedency, this will help you a lot. Unlike standard CI/CD, when you do depedency installs like `npm install`, the existing `node_modules` will not be cleared, thus speeding up the overall build time.

This is because our system is simply a custom-managed Virtual Machine. We don't apply containerization, just raw Linux capabilites.

### Simple Hot Fixes

If you spot a bug in production, you have the option to fix it directly by editing the live server. This may risky and inconvenient for large sites. But for those who with little technical human resources, it greatly simplifies the process of bug fixing. When things cooling down, one can see the diff and then reapply a proper fix to stream (git) repository.

### As close as running locally

Our servers is literally just a Linux server and you have a full access (non-sudo) to it. You can install any packages you want, run any commands you want, and do anything you want. It's as close as running a server locally.

## Support

Currently, DOM Cloud run as a service for community. Core developer resources is minimal but we strive to make this platform autonomous and easy to use. You welcome to ask in the discord or chat in telegram.
