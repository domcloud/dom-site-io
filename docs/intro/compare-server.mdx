DOM Cloud has many servers and they are different spec depends on capacity. All customers enjoy equal computing power no matter their current plan.

| Server Code (City, Country)  | Tier | vCPU | RAM | Root Disk | Home Disk | Backend | Has Docker |
|------------------------------|------|------|-----|-----------|-----------|---------|------------|
| SGA (Singapore)              | I    | 2    | 4   | SSD       | NVME      | x64     | Yes        |
| NYC (New York City, US)      | I    | 2    | 4   | SSD       | NVME      | x64     | Yes        |
| AMS (Amsterdam, Netherlands) | I    | 1    | 2   | NVME      | NVME      | x64     | No         |
| SGP (Singapore)              | II   | 2    | 12  | NVME      | NVME      | arm64   | No         |
| MNZ (Manassas, Virginia, US) | II   | 10   | 16  | NVME      | NVME      | arm64   | No         |
| NUE (Nuremberg, Germany)     | II   | 6    | 8   | NVME      | NVME      | arm64   | No         |
| OSK (Osaka, Japan)           | II   | 1    | 6   | NVME      | NVME      | arm64   | No         |
| SAO (Sao Paulo, Brazil)      | II   | 1    | 6   | NVME      | NVME      | arm64   | No         |

To make sure no abuse and no slow down, we have many [security features](./security.mdx) in place.

The rule of thumb is pick closest with your targeted visitors. As more people came in and use any server, the server spec will get upgraded.

Another notes we like to add:

## Tiers

Tier I are more stable tiers where less migration and less maintenance happens than Tier II servers. Tier I are planned to be unlocked only for subscribing users as it's more costly than Tier II servers. Tier II are lesser in cost but has higher in spec due to ARM arch efficiency. 

## vCPU

We use shared, burstable virtual CPU from many cloud companies. A high CPU usage can sometimes appear. If you want consistent uptime, we recommend to choose servers with higher vCPU.

## RAM

RAM are commonly higher for ARM servers and hence much more stable there.

## Root and Home Disk

Everything in `/home` dir is mounted to different "block" storage, hence the separation. Root disk performance is matter for database (MariaDB / PostgreSQL). Hence usually Root disk has much faster performance.
