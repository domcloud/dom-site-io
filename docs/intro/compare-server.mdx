DOM Cloud has many servers and they are different spec depends on capacity. All customers enjoy equal computing power no matter their current plan.

| Server Locations    | Tier | vCPU | RAM | Root Disk | Home Disk | Backend | Has Docker |
|---------------------|------|------|-----|-----------|-----------|---------|------------|
| SGA (Singapore)     | I    | 2    | 4   | SSD       | NVME      | x64     | Yes        |
| NYC (New York City) | I    | 2    | 4   | SSD       | NVME      | x64     | Yes        |
| AMS (Amsterdam) \*  | II   | 1    | 2   | NVME      | NVME      | x64     | No         |
| TYO (Tokyo)     \*  | II   | 1    | 1   | NVME      | HDD       | x64     | No         |
| BLR (Bangalore) \*  | II   | 1    | 1   | NVME      | HDD       | x64     | No         |
| SAO (Sao Paulo)     | II   | 1    | 6   | NVME      | NVME      | arm64   | No         |

\* There are ongoing project to migrate them to ARM servers for cost and performance improvements.

To make sure no abuse and no slow down, we have many [security features](./security.mdx) in place.

The rule of thumb is pick closest with your targeted visitors. As more people came in and use any server, the server spec will get upgraded.

Another notes we like to add:

## vCPU

We use shared, burstable virtual CPU from many cloud companies. A high CPU usage can sometimes appear. If you want consistent uptime, we recommend to choose servers with higher vCPU. We call these servers as Tier I servers. Otherwise, tier II servers can be your choice if latency much matters. 

## RAM

Tier I servers have higher RAM, hence we only install Docker to these servers only. Tier II has lower RAM spec, but we will fix it when we use ARM servers (like Sao Paulo Server).

## Root and Home Disk

Everything in `/home` dir is mounted to different "block" storage, hence the separation. Root disk performance is matter for database (MariaDB / PostgreSQL). Hence usually Root disk has much faster performance. The fastest disk is NVME, the slowest is HDD. Some Tier II servers that using HDD will be switched to higher version when we transitioned to ARM server.

## Backend

Most server uses x64 as the cloud industry has use it for decades. However there's new trend in using ARM server as it's more energy efficient, hence higher spec and smaller cost for us.

You're most likely don't have to worry about using ARM server as most linux programs support ARM architecture.
