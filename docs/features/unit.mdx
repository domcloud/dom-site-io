title: NGINX Unit Daemon
---

NGINX Unit is an alternative polyglot server that available to all servers, giving you choices over current albeit older polyglot server, Phusion Passenger.

NGINX Unit can bind to NGINX via `proxy_pass: unit` directive, then the app must listen to IPv4 localhost (127.0.0.1) and `$PORT` env much like how Passenger GLS works. So if your NGINX current like this:


```yaml
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: on
    app_start_command: env PORT=$PORT bun app.js
    app_root: public_html
    env_var_list:
    - AUTH_SECRET=secret
```

The new NGINX config will be like this:

```yaml
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  proxy_pass: unit
unit:
  app_start_command: bun app.js
  app_root: public_html
  env_var_list:
  - NODE_ENV=production
  - AUTH_SECRET=secret
```

NGINX Unit only use these three properties, `app_start_command`, `app_root` and `env_var_list`. Using NGINX Unit polyglot is recommended and we expect all new deployment will be using this method of deployment.

Other benefits of using NGINX Unit also:

### Persistent Logging 

App logs can be viewed in `~/logs/unit_stderr_log` and `~/logs/unit_stdout_log` via SSH and it kept persistent. Previously with Passenger you can only see app logs when it running and it can be tricky when dealing with app crashes.

### Surviving Daemon Restarts

Many people deploy new servers couple times everyday and that requires system-wide NGINX reload. Passenger processes binds to NGINX itself so all processes are restarted and this is not reliable especially if you deal with persistent connections like WebSocket.

NGINX Unit solves this problem because it binds to entirely different daemon, even your Websocket connection can persists across NGINX reload.
