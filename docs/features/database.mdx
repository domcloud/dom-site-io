title: Database Providers
---

Database is an integral part of any application. DOM Cloud provides a free, opt-in **MariaDB 10.11** and **PostgreSQL 16.4** database instance for every website in every tier. 

### Initializing the Database

Databases is opt-in, disabled by default. To enable it, go to [deploy tab](../intro/getting-started#deploy-tab) and execute one of these:

```yml
features:
- mysql
```

```yml
features:
- postgresql
```

See the section in [MariaDB](./deploy.mdx#mysql) or [PostgreSQL](./deploy.mdx#postgresql) for more information.

To view and edit the database using online tools, use *PhpMyAdmin* or *PhpPgAdmin*. Both available from manage tab.

:::info

You can't create or drop database from PhpMyAdmin, PhpPgAdmin or any external database client. You have to do that from Webmin UI or [deployment script](./deploy.mdx#features).

:::

### Using the Database

After activating the database, you can provide the database credentials to your app:

+ Hostname: `localhost` (because the database always live in the same server)
+ Username: Same username with server (see from [manage tab](../intro/getting-started#managing-website))
+ Password: Same password with server (see from [manage tab](../intro/getting-started#managing-website))
+ Database name: Usually username with suffix + `_db` unless you've created another DB
  - For example with username `hello-world` then database name will be `hello_world_db`
  - Check the correct database name from PhpMyAdmin or PhpPgAdmin

:::caution

Username and password is always different from the default. Don't assume `root` username with empty password will work for you.

:::

### Remote Access

Remote Access is used to manage databases using your local software -- such as DBeaver, HeidiSQL or TablePlus.

PostgreSQL permits remote access by default.

MySQL is more grained and doesn't allow remote access by default. You need to change it by go to the Webmin -> Databases -> Remote access then add `%.%.%.%` and `%:%:%` (next line above `localhost`) to allowed hosts list.

:::info

When connecting with Remote Access, the hostname is your website domain or the server's IP address, not `localhost`.

:::

### Timestamp

Our server always sets the clock in `UTC`.

A good idea to handle timezone is done by client processing (Javascript), both after getting the data from database/AJAX and before sending data/Posts to server.

If you don't care about timezone and you think it's safe to assume that your website is only accessed in one timezone, you can set the timezone in the backend using [date_default_timezone_set](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.date-default-timezone-set.php) for PHP or [`TZ` env](https://medium.com/developer-rants/time-zones-in-node-js-fc5a5b51906a) for non-PHP (set it to passenger's `env_var_list`). 

### Supported PostgreSQL Extensions

These optional PostgreSQL extensions can be activated using `CREATE EXTENSION` clause on a given database:

### Other Database System

Only three database system is supported: `MariaDB`, `PostgreSQL`, `SQLite`. For caching we recommend you to leverage filesystem.

You can also use third party databases that's also cheap (or even free) such as [Redis Labs](https://redis.com/try-free/), [Firebase Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore) or [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/cloud), just make sure the cluster is close enough within our server. 

If you wish to spin up a custom database server, you might be better deploy your website [using docker](../deployment/docker.mdx).
