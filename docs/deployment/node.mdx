# Deploy Node Apps

[Node](https://nodejs.org) is a back-end JavaScript runtime environment, executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Although Node is served as an compiled language, it doesn't emit binaries, so you don't need to compile your code before running it. 

There's a default Node interpreter from system but we recommend you to install it as your own through deployment scripts.

:::warning

Serving Node apps can be run using CJS-only binding or via GLS. If you choose to run via GLS, you have to listen from given `PORT` env/args. If you choose to run it via CJS-only binding, please note the default app name (that's `app.js`) and the path of node interpreter to run with.

:::

## Example

The deployment script below installs the latest `node` compiler and writes `app.js` and serves that through CJS-only bindings. 

```yaml title="https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/node.yml"
source: clear
features:
  - node latest
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: "on"
    app_type: node
    startup_file: app.js
    node: .local/opt/node/bin/node
commands:
  - filename: app.js
    content: |
      const http = require('http');
      const html_text = `
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html>
      <head>
          <title>Node App</title>
          <link rel="stylesheet" href="//unpkg.com/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css">
      </head>
      <body class="p-5 text-center">
          <p><img src="//images.unsplash.com/photo-1465153690352-10c1b29577f8?fit=crop&w=200&h=200" 
                  class="img-fluid rounded-circle"></p>
          <h1 class="mb-3">Hello, world!</h1>
          <p>Serving from Node version ${process.version}</p>
          <p class="text-muted">DOM Cloud</p>
      </body>
      </html>
      `
      const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
        res.statusCode = 200;
        res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');
        res.end(html_text);
      });
      server.listen(process.env.PORT || 8080);
```

With CJS-only bindings, it doesn't matter what port number `server.listen` is being assigned, it will be [corrected automagically](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/advanced_guides/in_depth/node/reverse_port_binding.html). However with CJS-only bindings, you can't use [ESM-style imports](https://konstantin.digital/blog/es-modules-all-you-need-to-know), you have to use GLS as the only option if your project uses that.

## Existing Node projects

For existing node apps, use the deployment script below. Note the startup file name (`app.js`) and the package installer (whether you're using `npm`/`yarn`/`pnpm` these all are already installed with the help of [corepack](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack)).

```yaml title="https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/node-cjs.yml"
features:
  - node lts
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: "on"
    app_type: node
    startup_file: app.js
commands:
  - npm install
```

Other deployment scripts we offer also listed below.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="esm" label="ESM" default>

For projects that using ESM-style imports, GLS binding can be used as it's the basic for any custom web server either for Node and other code languages. The requirement to use this is your app must listen to given `PORT` env/args (either `node ... --port=$PORT` or `env PORT=$PORT node ...`). You can also use alternative calls such as `node app.js` here.

```yaml title="https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/node-esm.yml"
features:
  - node lts
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: "on"
    app_start_command: env PORT=$PORT npm start
commands:
  - npm install
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="tsc" label="TSC" default>

For Node.js projects that using typescript, you need to build it first and let NGINX serve your JS scripts. We assume you're using a similar boilerplate [we linked here](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/express-typescript).

```yaml title="https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/node-tsc.yml"
features:
  - node lts
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: "on"
    app_start_command: env PORT=$PORT npm start
commands:
  - npm install
  - npm run build
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="nextjs" label="Next.js">

This is a typical deployment script for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

```yaml title="https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/node-nextjs.yml"
features:
  - node lts
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: "on"
    app_start_command: env PORT=$PORT yarn start
  locations:
    - match: /_next/
      alias: public_html/.next/
commands:
  - yarn install
  - yarn build
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="nuxtjs" label="Nuxt.js">

This is a typical deployment script for [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/).

```yaml title="https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/node-nuxtjs.yml"
features:
  - node lts
nginx:
  root: public_html/.output/public
  passenger:
    enabled: "on"
    app_start_command: env PORT=$PORT node server/index.mjs
commands:
  - yarn install
  - yarn build
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="sveltekit" label="SvelteKit">

This is a typical deployment script for [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).

```yaml title="https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/node-sveltekit.yml"
features:
  - node lts
nginx:
  root: public_html/.svelte-kit/output/client
  passenger:
    enabled: "on"
    app_start_command: yarn preview --port $PORT --host
    app_root: public_html
commands:
  - yarn install
  - yarn build
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Use other Node versions

To switch node version use feature syntax like `node stable`, `node latest`, `node 16.2.1`, `node 16`, etc. Check your current node version using `node --version` in SSH.

```yaml
features:
  - node 16.2.1
```

Node install scripts is powered by [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). 

## App Management

Your app do not restarted automatically after file changes. To restart, run `restart` via SSH.

Environment variables can be set either using NGINX's `env_var_list` or `~/.bashrc`. Usually your language framework also reads `.env` files.

See [NGINX and App Daemon](../features/nginx.mdx) for more information about NGINX and App managements including restarting, environment variables, and other global limitations.

## App Development

If you're editing your Node.js app in place (e.g. using Visual Studio Code Remote), it is helpful to run a separate Node instance so you can see your changes live using `nodemon` or `npm run dev` or other similar tools.

The requirement is you need to use port `32000` or above, since these port will not be blocked from the server. So when starting a development instance, use something like `PORT=31234 npm run dev` in SSH.

To apply your changes back to NGINX, run your build flow (e.g. `npm run build`) then restart it by calling `restart` on SSH.

## App Logging

You can see app log from Check -> Check Process Logs tab. Only startup problems displayed in the browser.

Please use a proper logging mechanism such as [Pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino) or [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) then write it to a log file, or any other solution that suits you.

NGINX errors and traffic logs can be examined via Webmin or Check -> Check Process Logs tab.
