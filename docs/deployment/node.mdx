# Deploy Node Apps

[Node](https://nodejs.org) installation is powered by NVM. To install LTS version with [deployment script](./deploy.mdx):

```yarn
features:
- node
```

Without this, you're using OS-dependent `node`, `npm` and `yarn` which the version can't be customized, and you can't install global packages with it.

Install other version using `node latest`, `node lts`, `node 20`, `node 20.1.1`, etc. To uninstall use `node off` or `node system` (the latter leaves nvm installed).

Corepack is always enabled when using installation via deployment script.

## Example

The deployment script below installs the latest `node` compiler and writes `app.js` and serves that through CJS-only bindings. 

```yaml title="https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/node.yml"
source: clear
features:
  - node latest
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: "on"
    app_type: node
    startup_file: app.js
    app_env: development
commands:
  - filename: app.js
    content: |
      const http = require('http');
      const html_text = `
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html>
      <head>
          <title>Node App</title>
          <link rel="stylesheet" href="//unpkg.com/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css">
      </head>
      <body class="p-5 text-center">

                  class="img-fluid rounded-circle"></p>
          <h1 class="mb-3">Hello, world!</h1>
          <p>Serving from Node version ${process.version}</p>
          <p class="text-muted">DOM Cloud</p>
      </body>
      </html>
      `
      const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
        res.statusCode = 200;
        res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');
        res.end(html_text);
      });
      server.listen(process.env.PORT || 8080);
```

## Existing Node projects

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="esm" label="ESM" default>

For projects that using ESM-style imports, GLS binding can be used as it's the basic for any custom web server either for Node and other code languages. The requirement to use this is your app must listen to given `PORT` env/args (either `node ... --port=$PORT` or `env PORT=$PORT node ...`). You can also use alternative calls such as `node app.js` here.

```yaml title="https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/node-esm.yml"
features:
  - node lts
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: "on"
    app_start_command: env PORT=$PORT npm start
commands:
  - npm install
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="tsc" label="TSC" default>

For Node.js projects that using typescript, you need to build it first and let NGINX serve your JS scripts. We assume you're using a similar boilerplate [we linked here](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/express-typescript).

```yaml title="https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/node-tsc.yml"
features:
  - node lts
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: "on"
    app_start_command: env PORT=$PORT npm start
commands:
  - npm install
  - npm run build
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="nextjs" label="Next.js">

This is a typical deployment script for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

```yaml title="https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/node-nextjs.yml"
features:
  - node lts
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: "on"
    app_start_command: env PORT=$PORT yarn start
  locations:
    - match: /_next/static/
      alias: public_html/.next/static/
commands:
  - yarn install
  - yarn build
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="nuxtjs" label="Nuxt.js">

This is a typical deployment script for [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/).

```yaml title="https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/node-nuxtjs.yml"
features:
  - node lts
nginx:
  root: public_html/.output/public
  passenger:
    enabled: "on"
    app_start_command: env PORT=$PORT node server/index.mjs
commands:
  - yarn install
  - yarn build
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="sveltekit" label="SvelteKit">

This is a typical deployment script for [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).

```yaml title="https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/node-sveltekit.yml"
features:
  - node lts
nginx:
  root: public_html/.svelte-kit/output/client
  passenger:
    enabled: "on"
    app_start_command: yarn preview --port $PORT --host
    app_root: public_html
commands:
  - yarn install
  - yarn build
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## App Management

Your app do not restarted automatically after file changes. To restart, run `restart` via SSH.


Environment variables can be set either using NGINX's `env_var_list` or `~/.bashrc`. Usually your language framework also reads `.env` files.

```yaml
nginx:
  passenger:
    enabled: on
    app_start_command: node app.js
    app_env: development # Set NODE_ENV
    env_var_list:
      - APP_SECRET=SECRET_VALUE
      - APP_CONFIG={"key":"value"}
```


See [NGINX and App Daemon](./nginx.mdx) for more information about NGINX and App managements including restarting, environment variables, and other global limitations.

## App Development

If you're editing your Node.js app in place (e.g. using Visual Studio Code Remote), it is helpful to run a separate Node instance so you can see your changes live using `nodemon` or `npm run dev` or other similar tools.

The requirement is you need to use port `32000` or above, since these port will not be blocked from the server. So when starting a development instance, use something like `PORT=31234 npm run dev` in SSH.

To apply your changes back to NGINX, run your build flow (e.g. `npm run build`) then restart it by calling `restart` on SSH.

## App Logging

You can see app log from Check -> Check Process Logs tab. Only startup problems displayed in the browser.

You might want to use a proper logging mechanism such as [Pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino) or [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) then write it to a log file, or any other solution that suits you.

NGINX errors and traffic logs can be examined via Webmin or Check -> Check Process Logs tab.

## Troubleshooting

### `FATAL ERROR: Reached heap limit Allocation failed` during package installation

We limit all processes to have physical 2GB memory to avoid crashing the whole system. 

Most likely you're installing with `npm` which is bad at managing memory, please use `yarn` instead.

### `digital envelope routines::unsupported` during script builds

You're using Create-React-App but having version that uses old OpenSSL.

Please update your depedencies to latest version with `npx npm-upgrade`. For `Create-React-App`, please try `yarn create react-app my-app` locally and copy all of their depedencies to your project.

### `You should not run the Vite HMR server in CI environments. You should build your assets for production instead`

Please do not run `npm run dev` or `npm start` in deployments. That's not how it works. Most likely what you want to do `npm run build`.

If you want to run `npm run dev` for live-in-production edits, use PORT > 32000 (e.g. `PORT=33210 npm run dev`).

### `error: cannot pull with rebase: You have unstaged changes.`

You have uncommitted changes in your server. To resolve it please do `git stash` then `git pull`. Take your stashed changes back with `git stash pop`.

### `Error: Cannot send secure cookie over unencrypted connection`

You have to set `proxy: true` and `secure: true` [somewhere in your cookie settings](https://stackoverflow.com/a/60104026/3908409) so it trust `X-Forwarded-Proto` set from NGINX.

### `UntrustedHost: Host must be trusted.`

You're using next-auth so you must set [`trustHost: true`](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/deployment#auth_trust_host). See [relevant blog](https://gause.dev/blog/fix-for-next-auth-error-behind-nginx-proxy).

### `pnpm: command not found`

You need to add `node` feature in your deployment script. Which enables `corepack` and `pnpm`.

### `502 Bad Gateway`

This is NGINX freshly restart and it seems too expensive to start your process in time. Please use [Proxfix NOHUP](./nginx.mdx#proxfix-nohup) to solve this issue.

### Any other error

Please open WebSSH or VSCode remote to fix it yourself. Or chat us if you stuck with "but it works on my machine".
