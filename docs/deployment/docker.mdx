# Deploy Docker Apps (Kit and Pro Plan)

Docker in DOM Cloud is powered by [Docker rootless mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/). Enabling docker features is implicitly allows running 24/7 (doesn't have to actually using docker). Because of how powerful and resouce consuming this is only available starting with `Kit` plan.

> Docker is available only in [Tier I servers](../intro/security.mdx) as they offer the most computing resources we currently offer

When this feature enabled, these things applied:

+ assign `/etc/subuid` + `/etc/subgid` to allow docker using sub uids for assigning containers.
+ assign `/var/lib/systemd/linger` to allow backround processes not get killed when SSH session terminates.
+ registering `dockerd` as user-scoped systemd daemon by `dockerd-rootless-setuptool.sh` and set it to run at startup.

## Example

The deployment script below activates `docker` capabilities and starts a "hello world" container for demo.

```yaml title=https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/docker.yml
# Requires Kit plan or higher!
source: clear
features:
  - docker
nginx:
  passenger:
    enabled: 'on'
    app_start_command: 'socat TCP-LISTEN:$PORT,fork TCP:$$RESERVED_IP$$:8080'
commands:
  - docker run -d --rm --name webserver -p $$RESERVED_IP$$:8080:80 quay.io/libpod/banner
```

Let's examine the reason why we use `docker run` commands as such:

- Using `docker run` will create and start a new container pulled from [`quay.io/libpod/banner`](https://quay.io/libpod/banner).
- We're forwarding to `$$RESERVED_IP$$` with a given port which is a random local IPv4 address `127.x.x.x`. 
- `--name webserver` denotes the name of this container is `webserver` for easy debugging when inspecting via SSH later.
- `socat` is used as port forwarder from NGINX to `$$RESERVED_IP$$:8080` which is what the docker container listen to.

The `$$RESERVED_IP$$` is a special constant and you can see the value replaced once the script has been deployed.

### Example with Docker Compose

To use `docker-compose.yml`, you can to run it via `docker compose`.

The example below setup [Plausible self-hosting](https://github.com/plausible/hosting) with their database depedencies.

```yaml title=https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/docker.yml
# Requires Kit plan or higher!
source: https://github.com/plausible/hosting
features:
  - docker
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: 'on'
    app_start_command: 'socat TCP-LISTEN:$PORT,fork TCP:$$RESERVED_IP$$:8000'
commands:
  - get_hash() { openssl rand -base64 64 | tr -d '\\n'; }
  - sed -i 's/8000:8000/$$RESERVED_IP$$:8080:8000/g' docker-compose.yml
  - echo BASE_URL=https://$DOMAIN > plausible-conf.env
  - echo SECRET_KEY_BASE=\`get_hash\` >> plausible-conf.env
  - docker compose up -d
```

We use the same technique to force docker listen to custom `$$RESERVED_IP$$`. Since many projects have variety of docker compose setup, you might have to manually edit your `docker-compose.yml` to expose the port that NGINX can listen to.

## Healthcheck

While your app and it services runs 24/7, sometimes your app can crash on itself. Make sure your docker containers can heal itself by adding health checks and run an additional [autoheal container](https://github.com/willfarrell/docker-autoheal). Please make sure the container autoheal binds docker.sock with your own rootless docker sock path by running `echo $DOCKER_HOST` from terminal.

```diff
services:
+ autoheal:
+   restart: always
+   image: willfarrell/autoheal
+   environment:
+     - AUTOHEAL_CONTAINER_LABEL=all
+   volumes:
+     - /run/user/1234/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
  plausible_db:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
+   healthcheck:
+     test: pg_isready

  plausible:
    image: ghcr.io/plausible/community-edition:v2.1.1
    restart: always
    command: sh -c "sleep 10 && /entrypoint.sh db createdb && /entrypoint.sh db migrate && /entrypoint.sh run"
+   healthcheck:
+     test: wget --no-verbose --tries=1 --spider http://127.0.0.1:8000 || exit 1
    depends_on:
      plausible_db:
+       condition: service_healthy
    ports:
      - 127.0.0.1:8000:8000
    env_file:
      - plausible-conf.env
```

Then run `docker compose up -d` again.

## Port Allocation Policy

Many docker compose setup have port exposed to local ports such as `9000` by default. If you leave them unconfigured you'll be surprised that it doesn't work, because we block them for your safety.

If you just want to expose your port for local development, you can change the port to above than 32000 (e.g. `33000` or `34567`). Be careful that anyone also see that exposed port regardless of the domain, which is why we recommend to bind your docker instance to a loopback address and bind them through NGINX.

## Managing systemd daemon

Your docker instance is registered as user-scoped systemd service. You can call these systemd commands to diagnose docker problems

+ `systemctl status docker --user`
+ `systemctl start docker --user`

## Custom systemd daemon

You can also create your own System daemon in userspace for your own background service. For instance, you might want to install your own PHP with additional extensions we don't cover.

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.local/share/systemd/user
cat << EOF > $HOME/.local/share/systemd/user/custom-php.service
[Unit]
Description=FPM
Documentation=Custom PHP FPM
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=$HOME
ExecStart=/opt/remi/php74/root/usr/sbin/php-fpm -c $HOME/etc/php7.4 -y $HOME/etc/php-fpm.conf -F
TimeoutStopSec=5
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
EOF
cat << EOF > $HOME/etc/php-fpm.conf
error_log = $HOME/logs/php-fpm.log 
[wordpress_site]
listen = $HOME/etc/php.sock
listen.owner = $USER
listen.group = $USER
pm = ondemand 
pm.max_children = 10 
pm.process_idle_timeout = 10s
EOF

systemctl enable custom-php --user
systemctl start custom-php --user
```

Then bind like this:

```yaml
features:
- php etc/php.sock
```
