# Deploy Rust Apps

[Rust](https://rust-lang.org) is an advanced programming language popularly used for speed thanks to manual memory management. Rust is served as an compile language, which means you need to compile your code before running it. 

There is no default `rust` compiler at system level. You have to install it first through deployment scripts.


:::warning

Serving Rust apps requires to be run via GLS, that's mean you have to listen from given `PORT` env/args.

:::

## Example

The deployment script below installs the latest `rust` compiler and compiles `main.rs` and serves that `main` binary. 


```yaml title="https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/rust.yml"
source: clear
features:
  - rust
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: "on"
    app_start_command: env PORT=$PORT ./main
commands:
  - filename: main.rs
    content: |
      use std::{env,str};
      use std::io::Write;
      use std::net::TcpListener;
      use std::process::Command;

      const HTTP_HEADER: &str = "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\n\r\n";
      const HTML_TEXT: &str = r#"

      "#;

      fn get_version() -> String {
          let stdout = Command::new("rustc")
              .arg("-V")
              .output()
              .expect("failed to execute process")
              .stdout;

          let text = str::from_utf8(&stdout).unwrap().to_string();
          let chunks: Vec<&str> = text.split(" ").collect();

          chunks[1].to_string()
      }

      fn main() {
          let port = env::var("PORT").expect("$PORT is not set");
          let socket_addr = "127.0.0.1".to_string() + ":" + &port;
          let listener = TcpListener::bind(socket_addr).unwrap();
          let version = get_version();
          println!("Listening for connections on port {}", port);

          for stream in listener.incoming() {
              match stream {
                  Ok(mut stream) => {
                      let response = HTTP_HEADER.to_string() + &HTML_TEXT.replace("{}", &version);
                      stream.write(response.as_bytes()).unwrap();
                  }
                  Err(e) => {
                      println!("Unable to connect: {}", e);
                  }
              }
          }
      }
  - rustc main.rs
```

## Existing Rust projects

For existing rust apps, use this deployment script. This project must have a `Cargo.toml` initialized.

```yaml title="https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/rust-binary.yml"
features:
  - rust
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: "on"
    app_start_command: env PORT=$PORT ./target/release/app
commands:
  - cargo build --release -o target/release/app
```

It's possible to run the app via `cargo run`. This eliminates the need to compile the code into a binary, although startup time may be a little bit slower.

```yaml title="https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/rust-gls.yml"
features:
  - rust
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: "on"
    app_start_command: env PORT=$PORT cargo run
commands:
  - cargo build
```

## Use other Rust versions

To switch rust version use feature syntax like `rust latest`, `rust 1.73.0`, etc. Check your current rust version using `rustc --version` in SSH.

```yaml
features:
  - rust 1.73.0
```

Rust install scripts is powered by [rustup](https://rustup.rs). 

## App Management

Your app do not restarted automatically after file changes. To restart, run `restart` via SSH.

Environment variables can be set either using NGINX's `env_var_list` or `~/.bashrc`. Usually your language framework also reads `.env` files.

See [NGINX and App Daemon](../features/nginx.mdx) for more information about NGINX and App managements including restarting, environment variables, and other global limitations.

## App Logging

You can see app log from Check -> Check Process Logs tab. Only startup problems displayed in the browser.

Please use a proper logging mechanism such as [the standard logging library](https://docs.rs/log/latest/log/) then write it to a log file, or any other solution that suits you.

NGINX errors and traffic logs can be examined via Webmin or Check -> Check Process Logs tab.

## Troubleshooting

### `Execution took more than 600s, exiting gracefully`

Please run `cargo build --release` via SSH instead.
