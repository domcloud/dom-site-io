# Deploy Python Apps

[Python](https://python.org) is a beginner-friendly programming language popularly used for machine learning and other scientific projects. Python is served as an interpreted language, which means you don't need to compile your code before running it. 

There's a default python interpreter from system but we recommend you to install it as your own through deployment scripts.

:::warning

Serving Python apps can be run using WSGI or via GLS. If you choose to run via GLS, you have to listen from given `PORT` env/args. If you choose to run it via WSGI, please note the default app name (that's `passenger_wsgi.py`) and the path of python interpreter to run with.

:::

## Example

The deployment script below installs the latest `python` compiler and writes `app.py` and serves that through WSGI bindings. 

```yaml title="https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/python.yml"
source: clear
features:
  - python latest
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: "on"
    startup_file: app.py
    app_type: python
    python: .pyenv/shims/python
commands:
  - filename: app.py
    content: |
      import platform

      html_text = '''
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html>

      ''' % (
        '//unpkg.com/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css',
        '//images.unsplash.com/photo-1465153690352-10c1b29577f8?fit=crop&w=200&h=200',
        platform.python_version(),
      )

      def application(environ, start_response):
          status = '200 OK'
          response_headers = [('Content-type', 'text/html')]
          start_response(status, response_headers)
          return [html_text.encode('utf-8')]
```

## Existing Python projects

For existing python apps, use the deployment script below. Note the WGSI file name (`app.py`). It's recommended to have `requirements.txt` so you don't have to install depedencies manually.

```yaml title="https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/python-wsgi.yml"
features:
  - python latest
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: "on"
    startup_file: app.py
    app_type: python
    python: .pyenv/shims/python
commands:
  - test -f requirements.txt && pip install -r $_
```

```yaml title="https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/python-uvicorn.yml"
features:
  - python latest
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: "on"
    app_start_command: uvicorn main:app --port $PORT
commands:
  - test -f requirements.txt && pip install -r $_ || pip install uvicorn
```

Other deployment scripts we offer also listed below.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="gls" label="GLS" default>

The GLS binding is the basic for any custom web server either for Python and other code languages. The requirement to use this is your app must listen to given `PORT` env/args (either `python ... --port=$PORT` or `env PORT=$PORT python ...`)

```yaml title="https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/python-gls.yml"
features:
  - python latest
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: "on"
    app_start_command: env PORT=$PORT python app.py
commands:
  - test -f requirements.txt && pip install -r $_
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="asgi" label="ASGI">


For projects that's use ASGI, we recommend to use [`uvicorn` web server](https://www.uvicorn.org/) and use deployment script below.

```yaml title="https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/python-gls.yml"
features:
  - python latest
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: "on"
    app_start_command: env PORT=$PORT python app.py
commands:
  - test -f requirements.txt && pip install -r $_
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="flask" label="Flask">

This is typical deployment script for Flask using WSGI bindings.

```yaml title="https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/python-flask.yml"
features:
  - python latest
nginx:
  root: public_html/app/static
  passenger:
    enabled: "on"
    app_env: development
    app_root: public_html
    python: .pyenv/shims/python
commands:
  - test -f requirements.txt && pip install -r $_ || pip install flask
  - echo "from app import app as application" > passenger_wsgi.py
```


  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="django" label="Django">

This is typical deployment script for Django using WSGI bindings. Note `app` is the project name, you may need to rename it beforehand.

```yaml title="https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/python-django.yml"
features:
  - python latest
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: "on"
    python: .pyenv/shims/python
commands:
  - test -f requirements.txt && pip install -r $_ || pip install django
  - sed -i "s/ALLOWED_HOSTS = \[\]/ALLOWED_HOSTS = \['${DOMAIN}'\]/g" app/settings.py
  - echo "from app.wsgi import application" > passenger_wsgi.py
  - python manage.py migrate || true
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Use other Python versions

To switch python version use feature syntax like `python stable`, `python latest`, `python 3.8.1`, `python 3.8`, etc. Check your current python version using `python --version` in SSH.

```yaml
features:
  - python 3.8.1
```

Python install scripts is powered by [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv). Python binaries is provided by [indygreg/python-build-standalone](https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone/). When just mentioning `python` it's equivalent with `python system` which installing pyenv but still using system-wide python.

:::warning

The python binaries currently have issues that they [don't have shared libraries](https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone/issues/227) which make `venv` or some legacy pip install broken. We advise to stick into `python system` until this is resolved. 

However if you have to upgrade simply refer to version which there's no binary version (e.g. `3.11.0`) to make pyenv compile the python binary, which is always works.

### Installing depedencies

Installing python depedencies can be tricky and easily overlooked. We have system-wide installation of `pip` and `pipenv`. When `python` feature is installed, `pyenv` will be available to shim `python` and `pip` to your terminal profile. When changing python version using pyenv, the python interpreter will be installed to `.pyenv/shims/python`.

When installing with `pipenv` all depedencies are installed within a custom virtualenv. You shouldn't have to use `python` feature at all because `pipenv` already does it for you. To run the customized python and it's pip installation in NGINX use `env PORT=$PORT pipenv run python app.py` in `app_start_command`.

## App Management

Your app do not restarted automatically after file changes. To restart, run `restart` via SSH.

Environment variables can be set either using NGINX's `env_var_list` or `~/.bashrc`. Usually your language framework also reads `.env` files.

See [NGINX and App Daemon](../features/nginx.mdx) for more information about NGINX and App managements including restarting, environment variables, and other global limitations.

## App Logging

You can see app log from Check -> Check Process Logs tab. Only startup problems displayed in the browser.

Please use a proper logging mechanism such as [the standard logging library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) then write it to a log file, or any other solution that suits you.

NGINX errors and traffic logs can be examined via Webmin or Check -> Check Process Logs tab.
