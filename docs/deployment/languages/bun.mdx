# Deploy Bun Apps

[Bun](https://bun.sh) is a recently popular Node alternative for back-end Javascript runtime environment. Like Node, you don't need to compile your code beforehand.

There is no default `bun` compiler at system level. You have to install it first through deployment scripts.

:::warning

Serving Bun apps requires to be run via GLS, that's mean you have to listen from given `PORT` env/args. `Bun.serve` is already doing this if you don't set the `port` explicitly.

:::

## Example

The deployment script below installs the latest `bun` compiler and writes `app.ts` and serves that. 

```yaml title="https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/bun.yml"
source: clear
features:
  - bun latest
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: "on"
    app_start_command: env PORT=$PORT bunfix bun app.ts
commands:
  - filename: app.ts
    content: |
      const html_text = `
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html>
      <head>
          <title>Bun App</title>
          <link rel="stylesheet" href="//unpkg.com/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css">
      </head>
      <body class="p-5 text-center">
          <p><img src="//images.unsplash.com/photo-1465153690352-10c1b29577f8?fit=crop&w=200&h=200" 
                  class="img-fluid rounded-circle"></p>
          <h1 class="mb-3">Hello, world!</h1>
          <p>Serving from Bun version ${Bun.version}</p>
          <p class="text-muted">DOM Cloud</p>
      </body>
      </html>
      `
      const server = Bun.serve({
        fetch(request) {
            return new Response(html_text, {
              headers: { "Content-Type": "text/html" },
            });
        },
      });
```

Note three things:
- `Bun.serve` already set the `port` arg from `PORT` env by default
- `bunfix bun app.ts` is used to run Bun with [a workaround of an ongoing issue](https://github.com/domcloud/proxy-fix)
- This bunfix proxies request to the bun app, this proxy support HTTP and Websocket 

For existing bun apps, use this deployment script. Please adjust relevant fields such as the startup file (change `app.ts`) and how `$PORT` is delivered (via `env PORT=$PORT bunfix bun ...`).

```yaml title="https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/bun-gls.yml"
features:
  - bun latest
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: "on"
    app_start_command: env PORT=$PORT bunfix bun app.ts
```

## Use other Bun versions

To switch Bun version use feature syntax like `bun latest`, `bun beta`, `bun 1.0.0`, etc. Check your current Bun version using `bun --version` in SSH.

```yaml
features:
  - bun 1.0.0
```

Bun install scripts is powered by [webi](https://webinstall.dev/bun/). 

## App Management

Your app do not restarted automatically after file changes. To restart, run `restart` via SSH.

Environment variables can be set either using NGINX's `env_var_list` or `~/.bashrc`. Usually your language framework also reads `.env` files.

See [NGINX and App Daemon](../features/nginx.mdx) for more information about NGINX and App managements including restarting, environment variables, and other global limitations.

## App Logging

You can see app log from Check -> Check Process Logs tab. Only startup problems displayed in the browser.

Bun can show runtime errors in browser by setting `app_env: development` in the `passenger` config of NGINX.

It's recommended to use a proper logging mechanism such as [Pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino) or [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) then write it to a log file, or any other solution that suits you.

NGINX errors and traffic logs can be examined via Webmin or Check -> Check Process Logs tab.
