- [PHP sites](./php.mdx) which forward requests to global PHP runtime daemons known as PHP-FPM.
- [Docker apps](./docker.mdx) which forward requests to rootless docker ran on each userland sysdaemons. 
- [Passenger apps](../features/nginx.mdx#configure-nginx-for-generic-apps) which spawns and forward requests to apps (see below). 

Passenger apps are the primary method for spawning many programming languages, each of them are defined here.
