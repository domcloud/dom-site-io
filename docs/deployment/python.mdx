# Deploy Python Apps

[Python](https://python.org) installation is powered by [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv). To install stable (latest - 1) version with [deployment script](./deploy.mdx):

```yarn
features:
- python
```

Without this, you're using OS-dependent `python` and `pip` which the version can't be customized.

Install other version using `python latest`, `python stable`, `python 3.10`, `node 3.10.1`, etc. To uninstall use `python off` or `python system` (the latter leaves pyenv installed). Check the current version using `python --version` from SSH.

## Example

The deployment script below installs the latest `python` compiler and writes `app.py` and serves that through WSGI bindings. 

```yaml title="https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/python.yml"
source: clear
features:
  - python latest
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: "on"
    startup_file: app.py
    app_type: python
    python: .pyenv/shims/python
commands:
  - filename: app.py
    content: |
      import platform

      html_text = '''

        platform.python_version(),
      )

      def application(environ, start_response):
          status = '200 OK'
          response_headers = [('Content-type', 'text/html')]
          start_response(status, response_headers)
          return [html_text.encode('utf-8')]
```

## Existing Python projects

For existing python apps, use the deployment script below. Note the WGSI file name (`app.py`). It's recommended to have `requirements.txt` so you don't have to install depedencies manually.

```yaml title="https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/python-wsgi.yml"
features:
  - python latest
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: "on"
    startup_file: app.py
    app_type: python
    python: .pyenv/shims/python
commands:
  - test -f requirements.txt && pip install -r $_
```

```yaml title="https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/python-uvicorn.yml"
features:
  - python latest
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: "on"
    app_start_command: uvicorn main:app --port $PORT
commands:
  - test -f requirements.txt && pip install -r $_ || pip install uvicorn
```

Other deployment scripts we offer also listed below.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="gls" label="GLS" default>

The GLS binding is the basic for any custom web server either for Python and other code languages. The requirement to use this is your app must listen to given `PORT` env/args (either `python ... --port=$PORT` or `env PORT=$PORT python ...`)

```yaml title="https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/python-gls.yml"
features:
  - python latest
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: "on"
    app_start_command: python app.py
commands:
  - test -f requirements.txt && pip install -r $_
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="asgi" label="ASGI">


For projects that's use ASGI, we recommend to use [`uvicorn` web server](https://www.uvicorn.org/) and use deployment script below.

```yaml title="https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/python-gls.yml"
features:
  - python latest
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: "on"
    app_start_command: env PORT=$PORT python app.py
commands:
  - test -f requirements.txt && pip install -r $_
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="flask" label="Flask">

This is typical deployment script for Flask using WSGI bindings.

```yaml title="https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/python-flask.yml"
features:
  - python latest
nginx:
  root: public_html/app/static
  passenger:
    enabled: "on"
    app_env: development
    app_root: public_html
    python: .pyenv/shims/python
commands:
  - test -f requirements.txt && pip install -r $_ || pip install flask
  - echo "from app import app as application" > passenger_wsgi.py
```


  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="django" label="Django">

This is typical deployment script for Django using WSGI bindings. Note `app` is the project name, you may need to rename it beforehand.

```yaml title="https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/python-django.yml"
features:
  - python latest
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: "on"
    python: .pyenv/shims/python
commands:
  - test -f requirements.txt && pip install -r $_ || pip install django
  - sed -i "s/ALLOWED_HOSTS = \[\]/ALLOWED_HOSTS = \['${DOMAIN}'\]/g" app/settings.py
  - echo "from app.wsgi import application" > passenger_wsgi.py
  - python manage.py migrate || true
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Installing depedencies

Installing python depedencies can be tricky and easily overlooked. We have system-wide installation of `pip` and `pipenv`. When `python` feature is installed, `pyenv` will be available to shim `python` and `pip` to your terminal profile. When changing python version using pyenv, the python interpreter will be installed to `.pyenv/shims/python`.

When installing with `pipenv` all depedencies are installed within a custom virtualenv. You shouldn't have to use `python` feature at all because `pipenv` already does it for you. To run the customized python and it's pip installation in NGINX use `env PORT=$PORT pipenv run python app.py` in `app_start_command`.

## App Management

Your app do not restarted automatically after file changes. To restart, run `restart` via SSH.

Environment variables can be set either using NGINX's `env_var_list` or `~/.bashrc`. Usually your language framework also reads `.env` files.

See [NGINX and App Daemon](./nginx.mdx) for more information about NGINX and App managements including restarting, environment variables, and other global limitations.

## App Logging

You can see app log from Check -> Check Process Logs tab. Only startup problems displayed in the browser.

You might want to use a proper logging mechanism such as [the standard logging library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) then write it to a log file, or any other solution that suits you.

NGINX errors and traffic logs can be examined via Webmin or Check -> Check Process Logs tab.

## Troubleshooting

### `ldpython: -lpython3.x not found` during installing Pip Packages

We use [prebuilt python binaries](https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone) where it doesn't have `libpython3.x.a`, which is a library for statically linking python. This is known for some packages like `uwsgi`.

The solution is try reinstalling python, but with exact version down to three digits:

```yaml
features:
- python 3.12.1
```

This way your python will be compiled from source by pyenv and `libpython3.x.a` will be available.

### Code won't update unless `__pycache__` files gone

We recommend setting `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1` to avoid this problem.

```yaml
nginx:
  root: public_html/app/static
  passenger:
    enabled: "on"
    app_env: development
    app_root: public_html
    app_type: python
    startup_file: server.py
    python: .pyenv/shims/python
    env_var_list:
    - PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1
```

Delete all `__pycache__` folders with this command and do `restart`.

```bash
find ~/public_html -name "__pycache__" -type d -exec rm -r {} +
```

### `502 Bad Gateway`

This is NGINX freshly restart and it seems too expensive to start your process in time. Please use [Proxfix NOHUP](./nginx.mdx#proxfix-nohup) to solve this issue.
