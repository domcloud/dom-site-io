This June 2024 update brings a lot of improvements in DX and our server speed!

## I use Tailwind, BTW

We migrated from Bootstrap to Tailwind CSS in our portal UI! Actually Bootstrap is good but doesn't have many controls and customization we're looking for, especially the new horizontal navbar that we needed.

<ThemedImage
    sources={{
        dark: modernUiB,
        light: modernUiW,
    }}
    alt=""
    className="mx-auto d-block mx-auto img-fluid mb-4"
    width="70%"
    loading="lazy"
/>

For a bonus, we introduce theme palettes to ease your eyes. Maybe you like a little green or blue to remind yourself to get a sunshine?

<ThemedImage
    sources={{
        dark: paletteB,
        light: paletteW,
    }}
    alt=""
    className="mx-auto d-block mx-auto img-fluid mb-4"
    width="70%"
    loading="lazy"
/>

We also fixed our UX flow to address many pain based on user feedbacks, such as adding helper inputs to common tasks in deployment systems such as adding new features and applying new config from existing frameworks.

<ThemedImage
    sources={{
        dark: deploymentB,
        light: deploymentW,
    }}
    alt=""
    className="mx-auto d-block mx-auto img-fluid mb-4"
    width="70%"
    loading="lazy"
/>

We also experimenting with NGINX config editor to cover common cases so you don't have to edit the YAML config manually and understand what it does easily.

<ThemedImage
    sources={{
        dark: nginxB,
        light: nginxW,
    }}
    alt=""
    className="mx-auto d-block mx-auto img-fluid mb-4"
    width="70%"
    loading="lazy"
/>


## Experimental NGINX Unit

[NGINX Unit](https://unit.nginx.org/) is a polyglot server much like Phusion Passenger, a polyglot server that we currently use.

During our experiment we found that while NGINX Unit have much harder learning curve, it is much resilient with restarts and has more rich in features. We ended up making it easier anyway with the introduction of [another proxy tool](https://github.com/domcloud/proxy-unit) that makes the integration much easier later.

We apply Unit to our WebSSH tools and it dramatically increases its reliability as the WebSSH connection survives during NGINX restarts, instead of the previous behavior where the Websocket connection dies when it does restart. It also have an option to separate logs and dynamic spawning comparable to Phusion.

As the configuration will be made available and it's proven to be better over time we'll sunset our integration with Passenger. Stay tuned for updates!

## More Localization Efforts

We have two big updates to increase our reach to consumers.

First, we're starting to accept crypto payments. Currently, we only accept ETH in Ethererium Mainnet via [Metamask](https://metamask.io/). We hope we can accept more currencies and wallets integration as we're start seeing more payment in crypto.

    width="70%"
    loading="lazy"
/>

Second, we're expanding our portal translation to 12 languages. Before then, it was just three. While we currently relies on machine translation, you can help us improve it by submitting PR requests to our [localization efforts Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/domcloud/dom-i18n)

        dark: translations,
