            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi, long time I haven't do some updates. I want to point out some statistics and key actions on what to do next for DOM Cloud.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="stat.png" src="/assets/images/stat-f51a4d37a16d2ae3a9e8eac13b2644d7.png" width="990" height="535" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>By number of statistics, our platform usage are steadily increasing. We also gotten some feedback from users, and guided with data and some reasoning, we would like to bring some changes to our plans:</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="change-in-plans">Change in Plans<a class="hash-link" href="#change-in-plans" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="free-plan">Free Plan<a class="hash-link" href="#free-plan" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The free plan storage cap is increased from <strong>1 GB</strong> to <strong>1.5 GB</strong>, while total of website is reduced from <strong>4</strong> to <strong>3</strong>. I think this is a fair tradeoff, because most websites nowadays are quite heavy with depedencies, and storage is quite cheap compared to computing power.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lite-plan">Lite Plan<a class="hash-link" href="#lite-plan" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Due to high processing fees, I think it's make sense to increase the price from <strong>2 USD</strong> to <strong>3 USD</strong> a month. With that in mind, these limits are increased:</p><ul><li>Storage cap is increased from <strong>2 GB</strong> to <strong>3 GB</strong>.</li><li>Data transfer is increased from <strong>2 GB</strong> to <strong>5 GB</strong>.</li><li>Total of website is increased from <strong>5</strong> to <strong>6</strong>.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-enforcing-of-limits">The Enforcing of Limits<a class="hash-link" href="#the-enforcing-of-limits" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Limits in the past is not enforced because how little the users was and support was very limited. Now with more users, I think it's time to enforce the limits so I can keep the platform stay on good performance.</p><p>Here's how it works:</p><ul><li>If storage or data cap is reached, all website will be instantly disabled and the user will be notified with email. Current option is to upgrade the plan or delete some files (only works if the storage cap reached).</li><li>If paid user has exceeded the expiry date, it will return back to free plan automatically.</li><li>Free user also has expiry date too, but it's 30 days after the last login. If the user has not logged in for 30 days, all website will be disabled and the user is notified before all website data is erased permanently within 2 weeks.</li><li>If free user's website has used a noticeable data cap (it means getting enough traffic), that user doesn't need to login for another 30 days (the expiration date is extended automatically, as a thank you because it means free marketing for us too).</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="upcoming-new-features">Upcoming new Features<a class="hash-link" href="#upcoming-new-features" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>There maybe not a lot of new features upcoming, because I will focus on providing good documentation.</p><p>Nonetheless, there maybe some minor new features or UI improvements in this month. Check back later!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In few days ago Heroku announced it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/25/heroku-announces-plans-to-eliminate-free-plans-blaming-fraud-and-abuse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">will no longer provide free plans</a>, which is also means a free marketing for us. I tell people people about this service in <a href="https://dev.to/willnode/comment/219m2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dev.to</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ripienaar/free-for-dev/pull/2570" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free-for.dev</a> and the result is a recent spike of traffic.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Traffic stat increased dramatically" src="/assets/images/stat-08d88618918cf3e1d1d68c3594cf4595.png" width="2238" height="1148" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>To get prepared for this spike, I need to adjust a few things:</p><ul><li>The New York server just been upgraded to 2 GB RAM and 2 vCPU immediately. This capacity is equal with what I use in Singapore server. Later if spike of usage still continue, I will use a separate mount drive for <code>/home</code> directory.</li><li>I will continue to complete writing the documentation, but there will be few changes: We'll remove the optional tools we've had installed (Ruby, Go, etc.) and the only things that preinstalled will be <code>php</code> (all major/version supported), <code>node</code> and <code>python</code> with specific version provided from OS. This will make our documentation clear and removing the dangerous depedency with OS environment which can change at anytime.</li></ul><p>There's also a few improvements in features and security that I would like to talk for the next month:</p><ul><li>The home directory will change into some random unique string rather than what you provided from the UI. This is because anybody can do <code>ls /home</code> and get all username list from the server. This might need take time because it may break existing scripts. Another option is to use <em>jailkit</em> but I'm not so sure it will not break anything.</li><li>we will provide a way to pipe the logs from server into portal UI. Right now the only way to open logs is from the Webmin UI.</li><li>The documentation, again.</li></ul><p>So that's it, see you next month!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a very narrow free time window I successfully redesign (again) the landing page, in fewer than 24 hours!</p><p>The new design reflects more about what this service about: it's for the niche, but packed with lots of server tooling that (hopefully) makes your dev life easier.</p><p>I captured the screenshot (in video) below. I like the dark mode button!</p><video width="100%" loop="" muted="" controls=""><source src="/assets/medias/new-landing-page-97b6b4910e015a2e9115440bb850b2c1.webm" type="video/webm">Sorry! Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><p>If you wonder, this new landing site is built using <a href="https://docusaurus.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docusaurus</a>, replacing our old simple website that's powered by Jekyll. I saved <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220612080708/https://domcloud.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the old site in archive.org</a> if you wanted to see the difference.</p><p>Anyway, I feel sorry that the proper blog and docs are just live today. Actually, a lot has gotten since 2 years I've been making this platform. Let's hope it get better every time!</p><br>]]></content:encoded>
