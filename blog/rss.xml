            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a very narrow free time window I successfully redesign (again) the landing page, in fewer than 24 hours!</p><p>The new design reflects more about what this service about: it's for the niche, but packed with lots of server tooling that (hopefully) makes your dev life easier.</p><p>I captured the screenshot (in video) below. I like the dark mode button!</p><video width="100%" loop="" muted="" controls=""><source src="/assets/medias/new-landing-page-97b6b4910e015a2e9115440bb850b2c1.webm" type="video/webm">Sorry! Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><p>If you wonder, this new landing site is built using <a href="https://docusaurus.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docusaurus</a>, replacing our old simple website that's powered by Jekyll. I saved <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220612080708/https://domcloud.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the old site in archive.org</a> if you wanted to see the difference.</p><p>Anyway, I feel sorry that the proper blog and docs are just live today. Actually, a lot has gotten since 2 years I've been making this platform. Let's hope it get better every time!</p><br>]]></content:encoded>
