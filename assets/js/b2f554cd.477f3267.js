I tell people people about this service in [dev.to](https://dev.to/willnode/comment/219m2) and [free-for.dev](https://github.com/ripienaar/free-for-dev/pull/2570) and the result is a recent spike of traffic.\\n\\n![Traffic stat increased dramatically](stat.png)\\n\\nTo get prepared for this spike, I need to adjust a few things:\\n\\n+ The New York server just been upgraded to 2 GB RAM and 2 vCPU immediately. This capacity is equal with what I use in Singapore server. Later if spike of usage still continue, I will use a separate mount drive for `/home` directory.\\n+ I will continue to complete writing the documentation, but there will be few changes: We\'ll remove the optional tools we\'ve had installed (Ruby, Go, etc.) and the only things that preinstalled will be `php` (all major/version supported), `node` and `python` with specific version provided from OS. This will make our documentation clear and removing the dangerous depedency with OS environment which can change at anytime.\\n\\nThere\'s also a few improvements in features and security that I would like to talk for the next month:\\n\\n+ The home directory will change into some random unique string rather than what you provided from the UI. This is because anybody can do `ls /home` and get all username list from the server. This might need take time because it may break existing scripts. Another option is to use *jailkit* but I\'m not so sure it will not break anything.\\n+ we will provide a way to pipe the logs from server into portal UI. Right now the only way to open logs is from the Webmin UI.\\n+ The documentation, again.\\n\\nSo that\'s it, see you next month!"},{"id":"welcome-new-landing-page","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome-new-landing-page","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-16-welcome-new-landing-page/index.md","title":"Welcome, New Landing Page!","description":"In a very narrow free time window I successfully redesign (again) the landing page, in fewer than 24 hours!","date":"2021-08-16T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 16, 2021","tags":[{"label":"service","permalink":"/blog/tags/service"},{"label":"update","permalink":"/blog/tags/update"}],"readingTime":0.76,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Wildan Mubarok","title":"Creator of DOM Cloud","url":"https://github.com/willnode","imageURL":"https://github.com/willnode.png","key":"willnode"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"welcome-new-landing-page","title":"Welcome, New Landing Page!","authors":["willnode"],"tags":["service","update"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Preparing for spike because of Heroku","permalink":"/blog/preparing-for-spike-of-heroku"}},"content":"import theVideo from \'./new-landing-page.webm\';\\n\\nIn a very narrow free time window I successfully redesign (again) the landing page, in fewer than 24 hours!\\n\\nThe new design reflects more about what this service about: it\'s for the niche, but packed with lots of server tooling that (hopefully) makes your dev life easier.\\n\\nI captured the screenshot (in video) below.
