Also, you would have to mind the other things to ensure scalability like using Redis instead simple files for cache (e.g. for handling cookie/sessions).

There are recent trends about GraphQL and NoSQL databases, and they're so scalable you can get rid of writing a backend code (provided with correct permissions to ensure security). A popular example for this is when developers create an Android App, mostly they use Firebase for the backend. Firebase already handles most backend aspect ranging from authentication, storage, analytics, to realtime database; This is also true for other services. The downside is that you have to consider this option since beginning, or risk rewriting everything from scratch.
