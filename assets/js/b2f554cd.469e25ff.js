I want to point out some statistics and key actions on what to do next for DOM Cloud.\\n\\n![stat.png](stat.png)\\n\\nBy number of statistics, our platform usage are steadily increasing. We also gotten some feedback from users, and guided with data and some reasoning, we would like to bring some changes to our plans:\\n\\n## Change in Plans\\n\\n### Free Plan\\n\\nThe free plan storage cap is increased from **1 GB** to **1.5 GB**, while total of website is reduced from **4** to **3**. I think this is a fair tradeoff, because most websites nowadays are quite heavy with depedencies, and storage is quite cheap compared to computing power.\\n\\n### Lite Plan\\n\\nDue to high processing fees, I think it\'s make sense to increase the price from **2 USD** to **3 USD** a month. With that in mind, these limits are increased:\\n\\n+ Storage cap is increased from **2 GB** to **3 GB**.\\n+ Data transfer is increased from **2 GB** to **5 GB**.\\n+ Total of website is increased from **5** to **6**.\\n\\n## The Enforcing of Limits\\n\\nLimits in the past is not enforced because how little the users was and support was very limited. Now with more users, I think it\'s time to enforce the limits so I can keep the platform stay on good performance.\\n\\nHere\'s how it works:\\n\\n+ If storage or data cap is reached, all website will be instantly disabled and the user will be notified with email. Current option is to upgrade the plan or delete some files (only works if the storage cap reached).\\n+ If paid user has exceeded the expiry date, it will return back to free plan automatically.\\n+ Free user also has expiry date too, but it\'s 30 days after the last login. If the user has not logged in for 30 days, all website will be disabled and the user is notified before all website data is erased permanently within 2 weeks.\\n+ If free user\'s website has used a noticeable data cap (it means getting enough traffic), that user doesn\'t need to login for another 30 days (the expiration date is extended automatically, as a thank you because it means free marketing for us too).\\n\\n## Upcoming new Features\\n\\nThere maybe not a lot of new features upcoming, because I will focus on providing good documentation.\\n\\nNonetheless, there maybe some minor new features or UI improvements in this month. Check back later!"},{"id":"preparing-for-spike-of-heroku","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/preparing-for-spike-of-heroku","source":"@site/blog/2022-08-29-preparing-for-spike-of-heroku/index.md","title":"Preparing for spike because of Heroku","description":"In few days ago Heroku announced it will no longer provide free plans, which is also means a free marketing for us.

I tell people people about this service in [dev.to](https://dev.to/willnode/comment/219m2) and [free-for.dev](https://github.com/ripienaar/free-for-dev/pull/2570) and the result is a recent spike of traffic.\\n\\n![Traffic stat increased dramatically](stat.png)\\n\\nTo get prepared for this spike, I need to adjust a few things:\\n\\n+ The New York server just been upgraded to 2 GB RAM and 2 vCPU immediately. This capacity is equal with what I use in Singapore server. Later if spike of usage still continue, I will use a separate mount drive for `/home` directory.\\n+ I will continue to complete writing the documentation, but there will be few changes: We\'ll remove the optional tools we\'ve had installed (Ruby, Go, etc.) and the only things that preinstalled will be `php` (all major/version supported), `node` and `python` with specific version provided from OS. This will make our documentation clear and removing the dangerous depedency with OS environment which can change at anytime.\\n\\nThere\'s also a few improvements in features and security that I would like to talk for the next month:\\n\\n+ The home directory will change into some random unique string rather than what you provided from the UI. This is because anybody can do `ls /home` and get all username list from the server. This might need take time because it may break existing scripts. Another option is to use *jailkit* but I\'m not so sure it will not break anything.\\n+ we will provide a way to pipe the logs from server into portal UI. Right now the only way to open logs is from the Webmin UI.\\n+ The documentation, again.\\n\\nSo that\'s it, see you next month!"},{"id":"welcome-new-landing-page","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome-new-landing-page","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-16-welcome-new-landing-page/index.md","title":"Welcome, New Landing Page!","description":"In a very narrow free time window I successfully redesign (again) the landing page, in fewer than 24 hours!","date":"2021-08-16T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 16, 2021","tags":[{"label":"service","permalink":"/blog/tags/service"},{"label":"update","permalink":"/blog/tags/update"}],"readingTime":0.76,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Wildan Mubarok","title":"Creator of DOM Cloud","url":"https://github.com/willnode","imageURL":"https://github.com/willnode.png","key":"willnode"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"welcome-new-landing-page","title":"Welcome, New Landing Page!","authors":["willnode"],"tags":["service","update"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Preparing for spike because of Heroku","permalink":"/blog/preparing-for-spike-of-heroku"}},"content":"import theVideo from \'./new-landing-page.webm\';\\n\\nIn a very narrow free time window I successfully redesign (again) the landing page, in fewer than 24 hours!\\n\\nThe new design reflects more about what this service about: it\'s for the niche, but packed with lots of server tooling that (hopefully) makes your dev life easier.\\n\\nI captured the screenshot (in video) below.

Actually, a lot has gotten since 2 years I\'ve been making this platform. Let\'s hope it get better every time!\\n\\n<br/>"}]}')}}]);
